# MLPROJ01-Movie_Recommender
Recommender systems are the systems that are designed to recommend things to the user based on many different factors. These systems predict the most likely product that the users are most likely to purchase and are of interest to. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc. use recommender systems to help their users to identify the correct product or movies for them. 

Why the Recommendation system?
- Benefits users in finding items of their interest.
- Help item providers in delivering their items to the right user.
- Identity products that are most relevant to users.
- Personalized content.
- Help websites to improve user engagement.
